I'm a software engineer and former startups and private equity and venture capital attorney based in New York. ðŸ—½

As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for beautiful, innovative and intuitive design to create the best user experiences and to make an impact by solving painful problems where my work is moving the needle. 

Currently I'm recreating the spreadsheet experience - making it easier to build & automate analyses with native data connections.
